# Snake
This project to get to know the ncurses library started on a train without any Internet access.
So it was manpages only. I did continue to work on the project back at home but stayed offline
as I thought it was a fun challenge to do some offline coding without any StackOverflow instant
solutions.

## How to play
Eat the food. Avoid the walls. Higher speed is rewarded with more points.

## Controls.
* Left / h - go left
* Right / l - go right
* Down / j - go down
* Up / k - go up

* p - pause / unpause
* r - new game
* q - quit
* -/+ - lower / raise speed. The actual speed of the snake will only change after starting a new
game to prevent players from increasing the speed just before eating and lower it just after
picking up the food.
